Mon, 29 Apr 2019 23:01:26 deprecation.py[line:323] WARNING From /home/user1/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/op_def_library.py:263: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
Mon, 29 Apr 2019 23:01:26 deprecation.py[line:323] WARNING From Bi-LSTM-Tensor-version1.py:151: LSTMCell.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.
Mon, 29 Apr 2019 23:01:26 deprecation.py[line:323] WARNING From Bi-LSTM-Tensor-version1.py:155: bidirectional_dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.RNN(cell))`, which is equivalent to this API
Mon, 29 Apr 2019 23:01:26 deprecation.py[line:323] WARNING From /home/user1/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py:443: dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell)`, which is equivalent to this API
Mon, 29 Apr 2019 23:01:26 deprecation.py[line:323] WARNING From Bi-LSTM-Tensor-version1.py:169: softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:

Future major versions of TensorFlow will allow gradients to flow
into the labels input on backprop by default.

See `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2`.
